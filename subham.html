    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <P>So, in summary, a tag is a single component that defines an HTML element, while an element consists of a pair of tags along with the content between them. Elements define the structure and content of a web page, and they are the fundamental entities that browsers use to render the content on the screen.</P>
<h2>About Java</h2>

<p>Java is a widely used, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, flexibility, and robustness. It was originally developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995. Java's design principle "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) allows Java programs to be executed on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly cross-platform compatible.</p>
